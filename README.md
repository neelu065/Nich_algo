# Niching Algorithm for multimodal optimization.
These code consist of different nich-algo which can be used to find multiple optima for given objective function.
Since these code are of Evolutionary in nature, there is not need for function to be continuous, even a discontinues function can also be used to find the optimals. 

## Different Niching Algorithm.
With the above folder consisting of different algorithm,the fINRAND1 and FNRAND1 are working perfectly for both hypersphere and himbalblau function with given constraint.
